# Key Functionalities to Add to Your Own DBMS Project (generated by chatgpt 4o)

## Core Functionality

1. **Data Storage and Retrieval**:
    - **Tables and Schemas**: Implement basic data structures to store tables, rows, columns, and define schemas.
    - **Indexing**: Support for basic indexing (e.g., B-trees or hash indexes) to speed up data retrieval.

2. **Query Processing**:
    - **SQL Parser**: Develop a parser that can understand and interpret SQL queries.
    - **Query Execution Engine**: An engine to execute parsed SQL commands, performing operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

3. **Transaction Management**:
    - **ACID Properties**: Ensure that transactions are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable.
    - **Concurrency Control**: Implement mechanisms for locking (e.g., two-phase locking) and handling deadlocks.
    - **Logging and Recovery**: Create a logging system for changes and a method to recover from crashes (e.g., write-ahead logging).

4. **Storage Management**:
    - **Disk Storage**: Manage how data is stored on disk, including file formats, data pages, and buffer management.
    - **In-Memory Storage**: Develop in-memory data structures for caching and quick access.

## Advanced Features

5. **Query Optimization**:
    - **Execution Plan Generation**: Analyze queries to create efficient execution plans.
    - **Cost-Based Optimization**: Use statistics and cost models to choose the best execution plan.

6. **User Management and Security**:
    - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
    - **Data Encryption**: Support for encrypting data at rest and in transit.

7. **Backup and Restore**:
    - **Backup**: Provide functionalities to back up the database at regular intervals.
    - **Restore**: Implement methods to restore the database from backups.

8. **Replication and Sharding**:
    - **Replication**: Support for data replication across multiple servers for fault tolerance and high availability.
    - **Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple databases to handle large datasets and improve performance.

## Utility Features

9. **Database Administration Tools**:
    - **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Develop a basic CLI for interacting with the database.
    - **Monitoring and Performance Tools**: Tools to monitor database health, performance, and usage statistics.

10. **Extensibility**:
    - **Stored Procedures and Triggers**: Support for user-defined functions and automated triggers.
    - **Plugin System**: Allow users to add custom functionalities or extensions.

## Performance Considerations

11. **Query Caching**:
    - Implement a system to cache query results for frequently run queries to speed up response times.

12. **Parallel Processing**:
    - Enable parallel execution of queries to take advantage of multi-core processors.

## Documentation and Testing

13. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    - Provide thorough documentation for users and developers, including API references and user guides.

14. **Testing Framework**:
    - Develop a suite of automated tests to ensure the reliability and stability of your DBMS.

## Example Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Storage Engine**: Start with the ability to store and retrieve simple key-value pairs on disk.
2. **SQL Parsing and Execution**: Implement a basic SQL parser and an execution engine that can handle simple queries.
3. **Transaction and Concurrency Control**: Add support for transactions, locks, and isolation levels.
4. **Indexing**: Introduce basic indexing to improve query performance.
5. **Optimization and Advanced Features**: Gradually add optimization, advanced SQL features, and utility tools.

Building a DBMS is complex and requires a deep understanding of computer science concepts, but it can be broken down into manageable components. Start with the core functionalities and progressively add more advanced features as your understanding and codebase mature.
